Project Summary – Retail Transactions Data Cleaning & BI Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete data-cleaning and analytics workflow starting from raw transactions data and ending with an interactive Power BI dashboard.
It highlights my ability to prepare, structure, and analyze real-world datasets using Excel, Python, and Business Intelligence tools.

🔧 1. Initial Data Fixing in Excel

Before moving to Python, several manual corrections were done in Excel to ensure the dataset could be processed smoothly:

Fixed inconsistent column names

Corrected formatting issues (dates, numbers, missing labels)

Verified data types and removed clearly corrupted entries

Resolved duplicated rows and formatting problems

This ensured the file was stable enough for automated processing.

🐍 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation in Python (Pandas)

Python was used to automate all major cleaning tasks:

📌 Structural Cleaning

Removed irrelevant columns that did not contribute to analysis

Renamed multiple fields into clear, readable names

Exported clean intermediate files for transparency

📌 Filtering & Data Quality

Isolated only approved transactions for business-ready analysis

Removed missing or invalid records

Standardized all values and ensured dataset consistency

📌 Date & Time Processing

Converted transaction timestamps into proper datetime format

Extracted analytical components:
year, month, day, hour, minute

Prepared the dataset for time-based analysis and trend exploration

📌 Database Preparation

Exported the cleaned dataset so it could be easily loaded into analytics tools

Ensured compatibility with BI workflows

📊 3. Business Intelligence Preparation

After cleaning the full dataset, the final table was imported into Power BI.
Python was used to generate the structure, and Power BI was used to:

Build a dashboard showing sales, product performance, customer trends, and brand profitability

Create interactive visuals based on the cleaned features

Perform RFM-ready segmentation and time-series insights

Produce a fully explorable dashboard ready for business use

🎯 4. Key Outcomes

A fully cleaned, structured retail transactions dataset

Automated processing workflow using Python

Organized fields for easy modeling in Power BI

Accurate time-based and category-based analytical structure

Professional dashboard ready for decision-making
